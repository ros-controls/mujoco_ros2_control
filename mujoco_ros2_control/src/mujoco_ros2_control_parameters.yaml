Optional parameter to load the PIDs that can be used with the actuators loaded with the MuJoCo model. The velocity actuator supports position mode with the PID gains, and the rest of the actuation models support both position and velocity mode provided the corresponding PID gains. The gains should be in ROS parameters format to be loaded by the control_toolbox::PidROS class."

A value of 1.0 runs the simulation in real-time, while values greater than 1.0 speed up the simulation and values less than 1.0 slow it down. Optional parameter to override the speed scaling parameters from the Simulate App window and just attempt to run at whatever the desired rate is here. This allows users to run the simulation faster than real time. For example, at 500% speed as set here. If this param is omitted or set to a value <0, then the simulation will run using the slowdown requested from the App."
